Slurm notes: https://slurm.schedmd.com/SC22/Slurm-and-or-vs-Kubernetes.pdf


Slurm covers several related HPC systems management tasks
○ Job queuing and prioritization
○ Job accounting
○ User access control to compute resources (cgroups, pam_slurm_adopt)
○ Large-scale job launch (MPI, PMIx, nss_slurm, sbcast)


Whereas K8s would launch things as pods or jobs


"MPI Operator" is the most commonly used component to ensure k8s pods launch concurrently


Slurm seems well set up for batch workloads; K8s for deploying long-lived services
